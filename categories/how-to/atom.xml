    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>UPDATE 2013-12-30: This is on hold permanently.  I never ended up having the time (this post is from way over a year ago) and PoE just isn&rsquo;t on my radar lately as I&rsquo;ve shifted more towards security and software testing.</p>

<p>PoE (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet">Power over Ethernet</a>) is an exciting and promising technology.  I think that a lot of people take it for granted now that you can plug your IP phone into an Ethernet jack and it gets data and power over that single connection.  It&rsquo;s easy to forget that your IP phone isn&rsquo;t a real landline with convenience like this.</p>

<p>One thing that has been frustrating about PoE over the years is not supply side availability but consumption side hardware for hobbyists.  You can find very cheap PoE switches online and that&rsquo;s great for all of your pre-fab gadgets (IP phones, WiFi access points, even video cameras) but implementing PoE in your own projects has been tough to say the least.</p>

<p>There is now <a href="http://canakit.webstorepowered.com/Arduino-Ethernet-Power-over-Ethernet-PoE-Module/dp/B005D22FR6">an Arduino board that supports PoE</a> but if you&rsquo;re using an existing Arduino board (Mega, etc), a Netduino Plus, or a single board computer you are still out of luck if you want to use PoE so far.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong you can do it but it takes significant electronics experience, a multitude of components, and even some luck since not all PoE mid-span devices follow the standard perfectly.  When using PoE with a non-compliant mid-span device you will certainly run into grounding issues that can range from a minor hassle to project killing either from noise or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke">magic smoke</a>.  I haven&rsquo;t experienced magic smoke yet but I&rsquo;ve definitely seen issues with noise and FTDI boards connecting and disconnecting from USB when hooked into a PoE circuit powered by a non-compliant device.</p>

<p>As far as the mid-span devices go you&rsquo;ll have to do your homework to find one that is compliant and that might even mean buying a few devices to test them out.  So far I&rsquo;ve had some luck with a <a href="http://www.phihong.com/html/psa16u-480_15_4w_1-port_poe.html">Phihong PSA16U-480</a> although there have been a few times where I&rsquo;ve gotten the network TX/RX to stop working while the PoE portion still works.  I never did conclude whether it was a circuit problem, a Phihong problem, or a cabling problem though so I would say that so far the Phihong has been the best.  On the other hand my <a href="http://www.intellinet-network.com/en-US/products/6897-power-over-ethernet-poe-injector">Intellinet 524179</a> has consistently caused my <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873">Sparkfun FTDI basic module</a> to disconnect from USB each time power is disconnected.  The Phihong does not do that and I have concluded that it must be a grounding problem.  To be clear my FTDI module in this case is being used to connect to a circuit that is powered by PoE but the FTDI module derives its power from a USB port, not the PoE adapter, on a computer that is connected to the same ground as the Intellinet 524179.  Because of this I would steer clear of this mid-span device if possible.</p>

<p>Now a company called <a href="http://silvertel.com">Silvertel</a> has released <a href="http://www.silvertel.com/poe_products.htm">a line of PoE modules</a> that finally make adding PoE to your circuits a much easier proposition.  With these new modules you only need 1 or 2 extra components to get yourself up and running which is a far cry from the 10 or more components I&rsquo;ve seen in previous designs.  Naturally you&rsquo;ll need to have direct, board level access to the magnetics for the Ethernet connection so it won&rsquo;t work in all circuits.  There are some embedded modules that don&rsquo;t expose the two taps needed on the TX and RX coil to make this all work so those modules will still be unable to use PoE right in their circuitry.</p>

<p>However, if you find that you&rsquo;re working with a module that doesn&rsquo;t have the proper taps you can always get a <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/voicesw/ps6788/phones/ps10042/ps10044/data_sheet_c78-502433.html">PoE splitter</a>.  These devices extract PoE power and either provide 48V or some lower regulated voltage and put that into a standard barrel connector.  It&rsquo;s not elegant but it works.  You must avoid any hacks where you put raw voltage on spare Ethernet lines as tempting as they might be.  Some people can get away with it during testing but there&rsquo;s always the risk that you&rsquo;ll fry something when you unexpectedly hook up the wrong port.  Do yourself a favor and stick with the standards for consistency and safety.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to get some time next week to try Silvertel&rsquo;s modules out.  Once I do I&rsquo;ll be posting my results and, if I&rsquo;m successful, some information on how to convert your Netduino Plus into a Netduino Plus with PoE.  Either way I&rsquo;ll post updates next week and keep everyone up to date on my progress.  I expect that if it works PoE will be a major player in most or all of my future projects.</p>

<p>What projects do you have that you would like to add PoE to?  What has stopped you from doing it so far other than a lack of time?  Post in the comments and let me know.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update 2012-06-16</strong>: This still happens on the 8.0.4 update so change the values that read &ldquo;8.0.3&rdquo; to &ldquo;8.0.4&rdquo; if you are using 8.0.4.  Also, if you have patched previously and try to run the script again after an upgrade you need to remove a file called &ldquo;/usr/lib/vmware/modules/source/.patched&rdquo; first.  The script will let you know that it won&rsquo;t patch because it has already been done if you forget.  Just delete it and re-run the script.</p>

<p>Today I upgraded to VMware Workstation 8.0.3 and immediately I ran into the following error message:</p>

<p>After lots of Googling I found <a href="http://weltall.heliohost.org/wordpress/2012/01/26/vmware-workstation-8-0-2-player-4-0-2-fix-for-linux-kernel-3-2-and-3-3/">a blog post with a patch for kernels 3.2.0 and 3.3.0</a>.  Unfortunately when I tried to run the patch it failed and said:</p>

<pre><code>Sorry, this script is only for VMWare WorkStation 8.0.2 or VMWare Player 4.0.2. Exiting
</code></pre>

<p>In order to fix this open up the script after you download it and change the line this line:</p>

<pre><code>vmreqver=8.0.2
</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code>vmreqver=8.0.3
</code></pre>

<p>Re-run the script and you should be good to go.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I ran into this problem today too when I first got FiOS installed.  Mapping a network drive won&rsquo;t work but using &ldquo;subst&rdquo; will.  I now have Media Manager reading my pictures over a network connection.  Here&rsquo;s how to do it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Open the start menu</p></li>
<li><p> Type &ldquo;cmd&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p> Right click on &ldquo;cmd&rdquo; and select &ldquo;Run as administrator&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p> Run subst like this:</p>

<p>subst DRIVE: LOCATION</p></li>
</ol>


<p>  DRIVE: will need to be a free drive letter like &ldquo;F:&rdquo;, &ldquo;G:&rdquo;, etc
  LOCATION will need to be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing">UNC path</a>#Uniform_Naming_Convention) to your network share like this &ldquo;\myothercomputer\pictures\&rdquo;
  Don&rsquo;t forget to include the quotes if your LOCATION has spaces in it!</p>

<ol>
<li> Restart Media Manager and try to add the new virtual drive to it, it should start working right away</li>
</ol>


<p>You may need to do this on each reboot.  I never reboot this computer so I haven&rsquo;t tested it yet.  You can put these commands in a batch file to make your life easier but you&rsquo;ll need to make sure the batch file runs as an administrator.</p>

<p>Let me know in the comments if it works for you or not.  If not I can probably help work out any kinks with you.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.timmattison.com/archives/2012/03/29/how-to-write-a-netduino-driver-for-the-grove-chainable-rgb-led/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-29T10:58:01-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.timmattison.com/archives/2012/03/29/how-to-write-a-netduino-driver-for-the-grove-chainable-rgb-led</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of people probably look at hardware that doesn&rsquo;t come with drivers for the Netduino or Arduino and don&rsquo;t even consider picking it up if they&rsquo;re new to this scene.  In this article I&rsquo;ll show you how I wrote a driver for <a href="http://www.epictinker.com/Grove-Chainable-RGB-LED-p/com53140p.htm">Grove&rsquo;s chainable RGB LED</a> by just carefully reading the specs and experimenting.  I am no Netduino expert, I have only written a tiny bit of code for it since I got it, but this just reinforces how easy some drivers can be to write.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that my illustration of how easy it was to write this driver is not a reflection on how easy it is to write <strong><em>all</em></strong> drivers.  Some drivers take a ton of work.  Make sure you read the documentation before you buy something so you don&rsquo;t get stuck with some hardware you can&rsquo;t use.</p>

<p>My first step was to find <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/index.php?title=Twig_-_Chainable_RGB_LED">the documentation for the protocol for this device</a>.  I then scanned around to find the &ldquo;Communication Protocol&rdquo; and started digging.  What this showed me is that there are two connections to support the protocol for this device.  The first connection is called &ldquo;CIN&rdquo; for clock input and the second connection is called &ldquo;DIN&rdquo; for data input.  Simple enough, especially if we&rsquo;re using the standard Grove base shield and connectors.  Just hook it up and make sure you keep track of which port you&rsquo;re using and you&rsquo;re ready to start programming.  I used header 6 on my base shield so the relevant pins for me were D6 and D7.  D6 was CIN and D7 was DIN.</p>

<p>Now you&rsquo;ll see that there are six well defined bullet points explaining the basics of the protocol:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Data needs to be ready before CIN, and DIN gets into the buffer on the rising edge of CIN.</p></li>
<li><p>First 32 bits &lsquo;0&rsquo; are Start Frame</p></li>
<li><p>Flag bit is two &lsquo;1&rsquo;</p></li>
<li><p>Calibration bits B7',B6';G7',G6' and R7',R6' are inverse codes of B7,B6;G7,G6 and R7,R6</p></li>
<li><p>Gray data MSB first, and the order is BLUE, GREEN, and RED</p></li>
<li><p>After all nodes data sent, need to seed another 32 bits &lsquo;0&rsquo; to update the data</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s step through these one by one to figure out how to send data to this device.</p>

<p>They first tell us that &ldquo;data needs to be ready before CIN, and DIN gets into the buffer on the rising edge of CIN&rdquo;.  What this really translates to for you when programming is that when you want to send a bit to the device you should set that bit on the DIN pin (either 1 or 0), then set the CIN pin to high, and then set the CIN pin back to low.  Now you&rsquo;ve sent one bit of data to the device.  Abstraction will make it so we can do this thinking once and then fall back on it later so let&rsquo;s write a function that sends one bit:</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>private void sendBit(bool bit)
{
    // Get DIN into the proper state
    din.Write(bit);

    // Set the clock high
    cin.Write(true);

    // Set the clock low
    cin.Write(false);
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This function makes the assumption that you&rsquo;ve defined cin and din elsewhere.  The setup for them in my case (using pins D6 and D7 as I described above) would look like this:</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>// Use D6 for CIN and D7 for DIN (Grove Base Shield v1.2 header #6)
OutputPort cin = new OutputPort(Pins.GPIO_PIN_D6, false);
OutputPort din = new OutputPort(Pins.GPIO_PIN_D7, false);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now they tell us that the first 32 bits are all zeroes and that this is called a start frame.  This makes me think it would be a good idea to expand our abstraction to let us send bytes and then write another function that would send this start frame.  That would look like this:</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>private void sendByte(byte data)
{
    // Send the bits MSB first
    sendBit((data &amp; 0x80) == 0x80);
    sendBit((data &amp; 0x40) == 0x40);
    sendBit((data &amp; 0x20) == 0x20);
    sendBit((data &amp; 0x10) == 0x10);
    sendBit((data &amp; 0x08) == 0x08);
    sendBit((data &amp; 0x04) == 0x04);
    sendBit((data &amp; 0x02) == 0x02);
    sendBit((data &amp; 0x01) == 0x01);
}

private void sendStartFrame()
{
    // The start frame is 32 bits of zeroes
    sendByte(0);
    sendByte(0);
    sendByte(0);
    sendByte(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In the sendByte function I&rsquo;m taking a byte and using logical AND and equals to extract the bits one by one.  One of the next bullet points says the data is MSB first so we want to get the most significant (ie. largest value holding) bits first so that&rsquo;s how I went about sending the bits.  Now that we can send bytes sending the start frame is as easy as calling that function four times with the value 0.</p>

<p>Next they talk about flag bits.  In the protocol it shows that after the start frame there are some flag bits.  This tells us the two flag bits are both ones.  Here&rsquo;s a simple function that can do that:</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>private void sendFlagBits()
{
    // The flag bits are two 1s
    sendBit(true);
    sendBit(true);
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now this part gets a bit trickier but not too bad.  They tell us that we need to send the inverse of B7, B6, G7, G6, R7, R6, followed by the actual color data itself as bytes.  B7 and B6 are the two highest bits in the blue color component, G7 and G6 are the two highest bits in the green color component, and R7 and R6 are the two highest bits in the red color component.  Sending that data with the functions we built up now is really easy.</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>private void sendColorData(byte red, byte green, byte blue)
{
    // Send the inverse bits of the B7, B6, G7, G6, R7, R6
    sendBit((blue &amp; 0x80) != 0x80);
    sendBit((blue &amp; 0x40) != 0x40);
    sendBit((green &amp; 0x80) != 0x80);
    sendBit((green &amp; 0x40) != 0x40);
    sendBit((red &amp; 0x80) != 0x80);
    sendBit((red &amp; 0x40) != 0x40);

    // Send the actual colors
    sendByte((byte)blue);
    sendByte((byte)green);
    sendByte((byte)red);
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re almost there, there&rsquo;s only one step left!  Now we need to send the end frame.  It turns out that the end frame is the same as the start frame but to keep the code readable I did this:</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>private void sendEndFrame()
{
    // The end frame is the same as the start frame
    sendStartFrame();
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now you have enough information to send a color to your device.  We should probably wrap it up so that we can make it even easier to use though.  Let&rsquo;s just think about how this is going to be used in practice.  A typical user will have a few of these LEDs chained together but for testing you might want to use just one.  We know that the protocol requires a start frame, then flag bits, then color data, and the end frame if we use a single LED but for two LEDs it looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Send start frame</p></li>
<li><p>Send flag bits</p></li>
<li><p>Send color data</p></li>
<li><p>Send flag bits</p></li>
<li><p>Send color data</p></li>
<li><p>Send end frame</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So for our first LED we want to send the start frame, the flag bits and the color data.  For our last LED we want to send flag bits, the color data, and the end frame.  Here&rsquo;s a function that does that:</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>private void setColor(byte red, byte green, byte blue, bool first, bool last)
{
    // Is this the first color?
    if (first)
    {
        // Yes, send the start frame
        sendStartFrame();
    }
    else
    {
        // No, do nothing
    }

    // Send the flag bits
    sendFlagBits();

    // Send the colors
    sendColorData(red, green, blue);

    // Is this the last color?
    if (last)
    {
        // Yes, send the end frame
        sendEndFrame();
    }
    else
    {
        // No, do nothing
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The extra else blocks have no impact on the executable generated so they&rsquo;re just there for clarity.  You can remove them if you want.  Now if you want to send a bunch of colors to a string of three LEDs you can do this:</p>

<p>``` csharp</p>

<pre><code>setColor(255, 0, 0, true, false);
setColor(0, 255, 0, false, false);
setColor(0, 0, 255, false, true);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>That would set a string of three LEDs to solid red, solid green, and solid blue.  That&rsquo;s it, your driver is written!</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/timmattison/timmattison-netduino-drivers/tree/master/drivers/chainable-rgbled-grove/chainable-rgbled-grove">my driver on Github</a> to see a few more enhancements I added.  My code has an abstraction of a color from three integers into an RGB object so it&rsquo;s easier to pass around and also has a function that can set a string of LEDs from an array of RGB objects.  There&rsquo;s some sample code as well and if you want to see the system in action check out these simple videos:</p>

    <id>http://blog.timmattison.com/archives/2012/03/28/how-to-fix-maven-errors-in-eclipse-when-getting-started-with-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven&rsquo;t used Heroku much yet but with the addition of Java to their platform I&rsquo;m starting to see it as a really interesting option.  Yesterday I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=mkmWwA0EoGg#!">a great video on how to get started with Java on Heroku</a>.  It went well until I tried converting my project to a Maven project.  Then I got this error message in all of my pom.xml files:</p>

<p><code>Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration</code></p>

<p>I checked the usual places but didn&rsquo;t find a solution to the issue.  Then I decided to try adding the m2e plugin from this update site:</p>

<p><code>http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases</code></p>

<p>After adding the plugin and restarting my IDE I got two different error messages:</p>

<p><code>maven-dependency-plugin (goals "copy-dependencies", "unpack") is not supported by m2e.</code>
<code>Project configuration is not up-to-date with pom.xml.  Run project configuration update.</code></p>

<p>The second error had a quick fix so I tried that and it worked.  Now the Java example application that uses the Play framework and the one that uses Spring MVC and Hibernate both work.  However, the ones that used JAX-RS and embedded Jetty did not.  They still showed the maven-dependency-plugin error.  The fix is to add the following XML in the build section of your pom.xml:</p>

<p>``` xml</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pluginmanagement&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
