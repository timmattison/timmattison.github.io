Today I just released [a few home brew tools](https://github.com/timmattison/timmattison-tools) that I've been meaning to write for a while.  I'm going to write full articles on them soon but just as a preliminary taste here are descriptions of the two programs I released today:




	
  * prcp.pl - Copies files and has a progress indicator

	
  * dirhash.pl - Hashes the names and contents of an entire directory to a single hash



If you use them please post in the comments below.  If you want to contribute to them just send me merge requests and open tickets!
