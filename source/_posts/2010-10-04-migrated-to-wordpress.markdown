I migrated to WordPress this weekend and after a few bumps in the road I think things are starting to settle.  Old static content is missing and the formatting of old posts probably needs to be touched up but it's a good start for now.

I'm going back and I'm starting to categorize my articles.  First, one will be called "uber" and is for the most technical posts.  Then the two other standard categories will be "mini-hacks" for quick hacks and "how-tos" for longer how-to type posts.

Comments have moved from Disqus to WordPress for now until I get a chance to install Disqus again.  Any comments between now and then may be lost.
