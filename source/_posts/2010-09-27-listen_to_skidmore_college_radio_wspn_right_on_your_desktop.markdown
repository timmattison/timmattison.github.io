My brother-in-law is going to Skidmore College and just got a radio show.  I don't live close enough to pick it up locally so I put together an app that lets you stream it over the Internet without having your browser open. Â It works on Macs, Windows PCs, and Linux boxes so you should be covered.

You'll [need to have Adobe AIR installed](http://get.adobe.com/air/) and then you can [download my app](/static/WSPNPlayer.air) and listen any time.  Let me know in the comments or via e-mail if you run into any trouble.

Android phones coming soon...
