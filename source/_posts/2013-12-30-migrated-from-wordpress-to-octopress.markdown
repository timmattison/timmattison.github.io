I finally got tired of dealing with Wordpress and all of the baggage that comes along with it.  I've migrated to Octopress and it feels nice.
We'll see if it makes me post any more or not though.  It appears that this is my only post for the entire year so far.

If you can recommend any themes that look a bit nicer than this please post in the comments.
