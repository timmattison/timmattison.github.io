After all these years I still use nanoblogger.  I love it.  It's simple, fast, and not much can break.  A few things broke when I reinstalled my operating systemÂ but after moving up to nanoblogger 3.4.1 and copying my old data and templates over we are back to normal.

More exciting posts coming soon... :P
