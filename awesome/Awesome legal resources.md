My very own list of awesome legal resources:

- [NYS local law search](https://dos.ny.gov/local-law-search)
  - Search for local laws (local laws for municipalities and county codes) in New York State
  - Broken as of 2024-06-19, of course
- [New York State senate legislation search](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws)
  - Search for legislation in New York State
- [New York State OpenLegislation 2.0 API docs](https://legislation.nysenate.gov/static/docs/html/)
  - If only they just put all the laws and updates in a git repository in the first place...
