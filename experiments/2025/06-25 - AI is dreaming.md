"AI is dreaming" is a project that generates images with AI models in a way that the models don't have any clear guidance on what the final image should look like. The goal is to see what it comes up with and see if the pattern matching that humans have developed through evolution can find anything interesting in it.

This playlist is updated frequently and ordered reverse chronologically (newest first). So if you come back to it after a while you're best off to just start from the beginning to see what's new.
