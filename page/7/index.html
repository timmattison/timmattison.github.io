  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Java making your objects serializable is often required to work with certain libraries (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/tutorial/RPC.html">GWT-RPC</a>, etc).  It&rsquo;s tempting when Eclipse tells us that our object is missing a unique identifier to have it generate one on the fly.  However, in practice what happens sometimes in the field is that you&rsquo;ll create a serializable class and then copy it to make a new class.  When you do this you&rsquo;re inadvertently copying the objects &ldquo;serialVersionUID&rdquo; field.</p>

<p>Why is this an issue?  Well, the serialVersionUID is supposed to be a universal identifier.  If it&rsquo;s not universal then you&rsquo;re asking for trouble.  When you deserialize a new version of this object or try to deserialize an object to the wrong object type you can end up with strange results or have your application crash altogether.</p>

<p>How do we fix it?  I&rsquo;ve written a command-line one liner (even though it looks like three lines on the site) that will print out a list of the files that have duplicated serialVersionUID values.  Here it is:</p>

<pre><code>grep -r serialVersionUID * | grep -o "private.*" | sort | uniq -d | sed 's/^.*=//' | sed 's/;//' | sed 's/^ //' | sed 's/^-/\\\\-/' | xargs -I PATTERNS grep -r PATTERNS . | cut -f1 -d ':'
</code></pre>

<p>Go into each of these files, remove their serialVersionUID field, and regenerate them.  Don&rsquo;t concern yourself with which ones overlap unless you already have serialized versions of these objects lying around.  If you do have serialized versions you should remove the field and reserialize your objects into your data store without it.  Then you can try to generate new values and again reserialize them into the data store.  DO NOT do this in production, always do it in a test environment to make sure that nothing breaks.  You do have unit tests that&rsquo;ll test these things, right?  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finding the size of an object or data structure used to be simple in &ldquo;the good old days&rdquo;.  You could just use the sizeof function and it&rsquo;d spit out something that usually made sense.  In Java there&rsquo;s nothing that seems to do it quite that simply.  I&rsquo;ve seen some solutions that involve using Java instrumentation but they have interesting quirks that can confuse things considerably.  For example, using it to obtain the size of a String object will always show 32 bytes as I found out by reading a thread on StackOverflow.</p>

<p>In any case I wanted something simple that would do the job.  My requirements were that there was minimal or zero setup, results were fairly close to the actual memory footprint, and that it work consistently unless I was using some kind of very strange data structure.  Here&rsquo;s what I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>try {
  // Get a ByteArrayOutputStream to catch the output of the
  //   ObjectOutputStream without going to disk
  ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

  // Get an ObjectOutputStream so we can dump the entire
  //   object at one shot
  ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(baos);

  // Write the object
  oos.writeObject(o);

  // Close the stream
  oos.close();

  // Query the ByteArrayOutputStream for its size
  return baos.size();
} catch (IOException e) {
  // Something went wrong.  Print the stack trace.
  e.printStackTrace();

  // Return -1 so the caller knows we failed
  return -1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Put this into your standard utility class as a static method and call it whenever you&rsquo;re curious about memory usage.  The output of this should be a little higher than the actual in-memory usage so you can consider this a high water mark for your object&rsquo;s size.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&rsquo;ve <a href="http://blog.timmattison.com/archives/2011/12/23/how-to-install-hadoop-on-debian-ubuntu/">set up Hadoop for development</a> you may be wondering why you can&rsquo;t read or write files or create MapReduce jobs then you&rsquo;re probably missing a tiny bit of configuration.  For most development systems in pseudo-distributed mode it&rsquo;s easiest to disable permissions altogether.  This means that any user, not just the &ldquo;hdfs&rdquo; user, can do anything they want to HDFS so do not do this in production unless you have a very good reason.</p>

<p>The error message you&rsquo;re most likely seeing if permissions are the problem is similar to this:</p>

<p><code>
put: org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Permission denied: user=tim, access=WRITE, inode="/user":hdfs:supergroup:drwxr-xr-x
</code></p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the case and you really want to disable permissions just add this snippet into your hdfs-site.xml file (located in /etc/hadoop-0.20/conf.empty/hdfs-site.xml on Debian Squeeze) in the configuration section:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;property&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;dfs.permissions&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;value&gt;false&lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then restart Hadoop (su to the &ldquo;hdfs&rdquo; user and run bin/stop-all.sh then bin/start-all.sh) and try putting a file again.  You should now be able to read/write with no restrictions.</p>

<p>Good luck!  Post in the comments if it doesn&rsquo;t work for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>UPDATE 2012-02-06</em>: <strong>The native library issue has been resolved</strong>.  You can now keep the native library installed with just a minor configuration tweak.  If you have already followed these instructions just scroll down to the core-site.xml contents and the commands to make the &ldquo;/hadoop&rdquo; directory on your machine.  Those two things will get you up to date.</p>

<p>Yesterday I passed my <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-training/developer-training/">Cloudera Certified Hadoop Developer (CCHD)</a> certification.  The four day class was great and I learned a lot about everything from the architecture of HDFS all the way to specific MapReduce algorithms and how to implement them using Hadoop.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited about implementing this in my companies as we&rsquo;re already using a home grown form of MapReduce for certain processes.  We chose MapReduce for ease of development as the algorithms tend to be surprisingly simple for what you get back.  This makes our system easier to debug and now with Hadoop it makes it as scalable as we can afford.</p>

<p>I wanted to get started with using Hadoop on our standard development environment which happens to be Debian Squeeze and not CentOS as the Cloudera course uses.  Luckily they provide a Debian package repository that makes setting up your development environment pretty simple.  This setup will <em>only</em> be suitable for production since you&rsquo;ll be running a single node.  In later posts I&rsquo;ll start discussing how to set up a testing cluster and eventually give some tips on working with Hadoop in production but for now lets just focus on development.</p>

<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll want to do is to edit your apt sources in /etc/apt/sources.list.  At the end of your existing configuration add the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>deb http://archive.cloudera.com/debian squeeze-cdh3 contrib
deb-src http://archive.cloudera.com/debian squeeze-cdh3 contrib
</code></pre>

<p>Note: This configuration is specifically for a Debian Squeeze installation.  If you are using a different release like Debian Lenny or Ubuntu Karmic you&rsquo;ll need to change &ldquo;squeeze-cdh3&rdquo; to match your setup.  You can <a href="http://archive.cloudera.com/debian/dists/">look into the repository to get a list of valid values</a> but usually it&rsquo;s just the release name followed by cdh3 (ie. &ldquo;lenny-cdh3&rdquo; or &ldquo;karmic-cdh3&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Next add Cloudera&rsquo;s public key into your system by running this command (don&rsquo;t forget the dash on the end of the command, it is required!):</p>

<pre><code>curl -s http://archive.cloudera.com/debian/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -
</code></pre>

<p>Now you&rsquo;ll want to update your package lists so that your OS knows the new packages exist.  You can do this by simply running:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you have an updated package list you can go about installing Hadoop.  For a standalone, single node development installation you&rsquo;ll need the following pieces:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hadoop 0.20 &ndash; The core components of Hadoop (the JARs, Python scripts, documentation, etc) but no daemons</p></li>
<li><p>The namenode daemon &ndash; To provide access to your HDFS volume</p></li>
<li><p>The datanode daemon &ndash; To store your HDFS data</p></li>
<li><p>The jobtracker daemon &ndash; To schedule and hand out jobs</p></li>
<li><p>The tasktracker daemon &ndash; To poll the job tracker, and accept and run Hadoop jobs</p></li>
</ul>


<p>To get all of that you&rsquo;ll need to run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install hadoop-0.20 hadoop-0.20-namenode hadoop-0.20-datanode hadoop-0.20-jobtracker hadoop-0.20-tasktracker
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have successfully installed Hadoop and the necessary libraries to run a single HDFS node that can run Hadoop jobs.  In single node mode you don&rsquo;t get any of the benefits of HDFS (block replication) and your Hadoop jobs won&rsquo;t run terribly fast but you&rsquo;ll be able to develop and test your code.</p>

<p>For development purposes your system is now running in standalone mode.  This means that if you run HDFS commands (ie, hadoop fs -ls) you will not be connecting to HDFS but instead you will be looking at your local file system relative to where you ran the &ldquo;hadoop&rdquo; command.  With this setup you can run local jobs and kick the tires so if that&rsquo;s all you need you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<p>I would personally recommend that you run in pseudo-distributed mode if you intend to eventually move onto a production cluster and will be involved at least in some way in its administration.  This is not to say that you&rsquo;ll be the administrator of the cluster but that you&rsquo;ll at least be one of the people called upon to figure out production problems that range from HDFS issues to failed or buggy jobs.</p>

<p>In pseudo-distributed mode you will really be running jobs through the entire Hadoop workflow and will be able to tell whether your jobs will run on a cluster or not.  There are still some gotchas that differ from running fully distributed vs. pseudo-distributed but if you follow best practices and defensive coding you can usually avoid them.  For example you should never depend on local state or the availability of files on the local file system.  Always read through HDFS if it&rsquo;s necessary and never use globals in your code that could be modified, or even accessed, between map and reduce tasks.  Now onto pseudo-distributed mode&hellip;</p>

<p>Cloudera has done a lot for you up to this point including applying hundreds of patches that you&rsquo;ll be glad you don&rsquo;t need to worry about but now you&rsquo;ll need to do some configuration.  This is intentional since you can use CDH to run anything from a development node to a production cluster.  Therefore they don&rsquo;t make any assumptions as to how you want the nodes configured.  Being consistent in development and production and you&rsquo;ll make your life a lot easier when you need to debug something as everyone will be familiar with the same layout, major/minor release number, etc.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take care of the configuration steps one-by-one now.  The steps are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set JAVA_HOME in the hadoop-env.sh script</p></li>
<li><p>Configure core-site.xml</p></li>
<li><p>Configure hdfs-site.xml</p></li>
<li><p>Configure mapred-site.xml</p></li>
<li><p>Setup passphraseless ssh</p></li>
<li><p>Format the namenode</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Once that is complete you can start all of the required processes and begin testing but keep reading for a walkthrough of each of these steps.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make sure JAVA_HOME is set in your hadoop-env.sh script.  On Debian Squeeze this is located in /etc/hadoop-0.20/conf.empty/hadoop-env.sh.  By default JAVA_HOME is NOT set in hadoop-env.sh.  If you have it set in your profile already I would suggest copying that export line to hadoop-env.sh just in case you run the daemons later as a different user that might not have the same profile.  If you don&rsquo;t know what your JAVA_HOME value should be you can run this one-liner (<a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/143786/how-to-determine-java-home-on-debian-ubuntu">credits to a thread on ServerFault for this one</a>):</p>

<pre><code>export JAVA_HOME=$(readlink -f /usr/bin/java | sed "s:bin/java::")
</code></pre>

<p>To verify that it is set run:</p>

<pre><code>export | grep JAVA_HOME
</code></pre>

<p>And then list the contents of the directory that it references.  It should contain a bin, lib, and man directory.  If so, copy the entire export line into the beginning of the hadoop-env.sh script where it has been commented out.  If they have the same JAVA_HOME specified you can just uncomment that line.  Now whomever is starting the Hadoop processes (you, the hdfs user, or root) will always have JAVA_HOME set properly.</p>

<p>Guidance for the next few steps was taken from the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.20.2/quickstart.html#Configuration">Hadoop Quick Start&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pseudo-Distributed Operation: Configuration&rdquo; section</a>.  Refer there for additional information.  I have just added some narrative to let you know what each of these steps does so you understand a bit more about how the system works.</p>

<p>Note: The XML files are owned by root and are accessible by the hadoop group.  Edit the files as root but run any commands below as the &ldquo;hdfs&rdquo; user.</p>

<p>core-site.xml (located in /etc/hadoop-0.20/conf.empty/core-site.xml on Debian Squeeze) needs to be modified to let the everyone know where the name node is running.  In our case it will be running on localhost on the default port so add this snippet of XML between the configuration tags in core-site.xml:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;property&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;fs.default.name&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;value&gt;hdfs://localhost:9000&lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;

  &lt;property&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;hadoop.tmp.dir&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;value&gt;/hadoop/hadoop-${user.name}&lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After adding these settings you&rsquo;ll need to make sure that the /hadoop base directory has been created with the proper permissions to let all users get access to it.  In production your security criteria may be different so only use this for development machines since it leaves everything pretty open!  To create the directory you&rsquo;ll want to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkdir /hadoop &amp;&amp; sudo chown hdfs:hdfs /hadoop &amp;&amp; sudo chmod 777 /hadoop
</code></pre>

<p>Now you will have the /hadoop path created on permanent storage instead of it getting placed on tmpfs where the default values would normally place it.</p>

<p>hdfs-site.xml (located in /etc/hadoop-0.20/conf.empty/hdfs-site.xml on Debian Squeeze) needs to be modified to tell the HDFS daemons that we only want a replication factor of 1.  This doesn&rsquo;t matter so much since HDFS won&rsquo;t try to replicate the same block multiple times on one data node but if you start running multiple data nodes on a single development machine it will save you some disk space.  So put this snippet of XML between the configuration tags in hdfs-site.xml:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;property&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;dfs.replication&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;value&gt;1&lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>mapred-site.xml (located in /etc/hadoop-0.20/conf.empty/mapred-site.xml on Debian Squeeze) needs to be modified to let everyone know where the job tracker is running.  In our case it will be running on localhost on the default port so add this snippet of XML between the configuration tags in mapred-site.xml:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;property&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;mapred.job.tracker&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;value&gt;localhost:9001&lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As root you&rsquo;ll need to run two commands to make sure that the rest of the config will work as the &ldquo;hdfs&rdquo; user.  You need to create a directory for the &ldquo;hdfs&rdquo; user to store its SSH credentials.  To do this run the following commands (again, as root):</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /usr/lib/hadoop-0.20/.ssh
chown hdfs:hdfs /usr/lib/hadoop-0.20/.ssh
</code></pre>

<p>This is assuming that your hadoop directory is /usr/lib/hadoop-0.20.  To verify where it is if you aren&rsquo;t sure su to the &ldquo;hdfs&rdquo; user and run &ldquo;pwd&rdquo;.  That will be the directory where this should be done.</p>

<p>Remember to run all of the steps from here as the &ldquo;hdfs&rdquo; user or it will not work.</p>

<p>Passphraseless SSH is required so that the scripts can connect to servers and start/stop services in a cluster.  To make sure you can ssh without a password localhost first try this:</p>

<pre><code>ssh localhost
</code></pre>

<p>If you are prompted for a password it has not been set up yet.  To set it up you&rsquo;ll need to generate a public/private key pair and then tell SSH to accept the public key as a valid login credential.  Do this by running the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t dsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre>

<p>Try to ssh to localhost now and make sure that it works.  <strong><em>If you skip this step the host&rsquo;s key will not be added to the list of known hosts and the non-interactive processes will fail</em></strong>.</p>

<p>If the ssh-keygen command prompts you to overwrite your key <strong><em>DO NOT DO IT</em></strong>!  This will break any existing key-based SSH connections have already.  Just say no if asked to overwrite your key.  Adding an existing key to the list of authorized keys will still work.</p>

<p>The last configuration step is to format the name node.  This will make sure the name node has all of its data structures on disk set up properly so that it can track your HDFS data.  To do this just run the following hadoop (located in /usr/bin/hadoop on Debian Squeeze) command:</p>

<pre><code>hadoop namenode -format
</code></pre>

<p>If you are asked to reformat the filesystem you must make sure that nobody else is already running Hadoop on this machine.  If they are and you reformat the name node you will end up wiping out their data.  It is recoverable but you don&rsquo;t want to have to go through that as it is time consuming and not guaranteed to work.</p>

<p>Now that everything is set up you can start everything by running the start-all.sh (located in /usr/lib/hadoop-0.20/bin/start-all.sh on Debian Squeeze) script:</p>

<pre><code>start-all.sh
</code></pre>

<p>If you didn&rsquo;t see any errors you should be up and running.  Here are some things that we should verify to make sure that everything works as expected:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Run &ldquo;jps&rdquo; and verify all of the processes are there</p></li>
<li><p>Test the name node&rsquo;s web GUI</p></li>
<li><p>Test the job tracker&rsquo;s web GUI</p></li>
<li><p>Test HDFS</p></li>
<li><p>Run a Hadoop MapReduce example</p></li>
</ul>


<p>When you run &ldquo;jps&rdquo; you should get a list of processes including &ldquo;TaskTracker&rdquo;, &ldquo;JobTracker&rdquo;, &ldquo;SecondaryNameNode&rdquo;, &ldquo;DataNode&rdquo;, and &ldquo;NameNode&rdquo;.  If any of these are missing check the log directory.  On my first run the name node failed to come up and it was because I had manually created the /tmp/hadoop-hdfs/dfs/name directory when doing some earlier testing.  After that the name node format failed silently.  If you get an exception that reads &ldquo;java.io.IOException: NameNode is not formatted.&rdquo; you should run stop-all.sh, then remove the /tmp/hadoop-hdfs directory (again, make sure nobody else is running Hadoop on your machine!), and then reformat the name node and restart the processes with start-all.sh.</p>

<p>Now that all of the processes are running check that the <a href="http://localhost:50030">job tracker web GUI</a> and the <a href="http://localhost:50070">name node web GUI</a> are running.  If both of those links bring up web pages without errors then they are both running properly.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s test HDFS with some simple commands.  You should still be the &ldquo;hdfs&rdquo; user for this.  Don&rsquo;t change back to your regular user account yet.  First, list the files on the HDFS volume with this command:</p>

<pre><code>hadoop fs -ls
</code></pre>

<p>When you first run this you should get an error that reads &ldquo;ls: Cannot access .: No such file or directory.&rdquo;.  That&rsquo;s OK.  Let&rsquo;s put a file there any make sure that it works.  Generate a file full of random data with this command:</p>

<pre><code>head -c 1048576 /dev/urandom &gt; /tmp/random.txt
hadoop fs -put /tmp/random.txt random.txt
</code></pre>

<p>If those commands give you errors try <a href="http://blog.timmattison.com/archives/2011/12/26/how-to-disable-hdfs-permissions-for-hadoop-development/">disabling HDFS permissions</a>, then stop and restart everything with the stop-all.sh, and start-all.sh scripts.  Then come back here and try again.</p>

<p>Now list the files again as you did above and you should see a 1 MB file called random.txt.  Verify that the input file and the output file match by comparing their sha1sums:</p>

<pre><code>sha1sum /tmp/random.txt
hadoop fs -cat random.txt | sha1sum
</code></pre>

<p>You should get two hex strings on separate lines that match.  You can ignore the filename portion of the result since one run is taking the data from the local filesystem and the other is reading the data from HDFS and piping it to sha1sum.</p>

<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s run a MapReduce job.  There are a few example jobs included with the default installation and the simplest one is grep.  We&rsquo;ll need to build a file that we want to grep, put it on HDFS, run the job, and compare the results to running a non-MapReduce grep on it.</p>

<p>I wanted to build a file that was bigger than a single tiny text file I ran the following command (still as the &ldquo;hdfs&rdquo; user):</p>

<pre><code>find /etc -exec cat {} \; | strings &gt; /tmp/etc-dir.txt
</code></pre>

<p>This reads all of the files in the /etc directory, extracts everything that looks like a string so we don&rsquo;t end up with a binary mess, and puts it in the /tmp/etc-dir.txt.  I then put that file onto HDFS:</p>

<pre><code>hadoop fs -put /tmp/etc-dir.txt etc-dir.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Then I ran a MapReduce job that returns the number of occurrences of the string &ldquo;localhost&rdquo; in the file:</p>

<pre><code>cd /usr/lib/hadoop-0.20
hadoop jar hadoop-*-examples.jar grep etc-dir.txt etc-dir-results localhost
</code></pre>

<p>And I compared that to counting the occurrences with grep:</p>

<pre><code>hadoop fs -cat etc-dir-results/part-00000
grep localhost /tmp/etc-dir.txt | wc -l
</code></pre>

<p>To verify that it worked I should see two lines of text that both start with the same number.  The first line will contain the string &ldquo;localhost&rdquo; on the end of it, the second one will not.</p>

<p>If you got this far you&rsquo;ve now got a working Hadoop developer setup.  If not, post in the comments and I&rsquo;ll try to help out and update the tutorial with more information.  Good luck!  Hadoop is an exciting tool with lots of applications that I&rsquo;ll explore in future posts.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re going to get serious with it look into getting a CCHD certification.  With it you&rsquo;ll skip a few very hard months of work on your own in just four days and you&rsquo;ll come out of it with a sound understanding of HDFS, the MapReduce process, and get a lot of good tips on what you should and shouldn&rsquo;t do.  The instructors are very knowledgeable, have a large support network to answer your domain specific questions, and it can be a great networking opportunity.  If you have questions about the course post them in the comments too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I had to reinstall the Android plugin on my system and I recently upgraded to a 64-bit development VM.  To my surprise the installation didn&rsquo;t go smoothly at all.  After restarting Eclipse twice I was constantly presented with two error messages &ldquo;Failed to parse the output of &lsquo;adb version&rsquo;&rdquo; and &ldquo;adb: error while loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory&rdquo;.  Your system may also present another error message that reads &ldquo;adb: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I could see that it was looking for libncurses.so.5 however I know that ncurses is already installed on my machine in /lib as /lib/libncurses.so.5.  So where exactly was Eclipse/adb looking for it?  It turns out that it wants to find its libraries in the /lib32 directory but you can&rsquo;t just symlink it or you&rsquo;ll get an error that reads &ldquo;wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64&rdquo;.  adb needs to have the 32-bit versions installed or it won&rsquo;t function at all.</p>

<p>So to get up and running just run the following command to fix the issue:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install lib32ncurses5 lib32stdc++6
</code></pre>

<p>After that just restart Eclipse and the issue should be fully put to bed.  Let me know how it works out for you or if you run into trouble.</p>

<p>If you still run into trouble like an error message that reads &ldquo;aapt: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory&rdquo; you need to install the ia32-libs like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
</code></pre>

<p>Then rebuild your project and the errors should be gone.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2012-02-14: Rortian reports that the following command words on Fedora 16:</p>

<pre><code>yum install ncurses-libs.i686 libstdc++.i686 libgcc.i686
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are reading this article I, unlike the rest of the Internet, will assume you have a good reason to run Teamviewer as root.  I won&rsquo;t spend my time trying to talk you out of it.  :)</p>

<p>You can accomplish this in just a few quick steps:</p>

<p>1) Install Teamviewer 6
2) Try to run it as root, if you get the message &ldquo;TeamViewer must not be executed as root!&rdquo; go on to step 3.  Otherwise, you are already set up.
3) Open /opt/teamviewer/teamviewer/6/bin/wrapper in your favorite text editor
4) Look for a line similar to this: &ldquo;validate_user                  # die if root&rdquo;
5) Put a single hash/octothorpe in front of the line and save it so it looks like &ldquo;#validate_user              # die if root&rdquo;.
6) Restart Teamviewer as root and you&rsquo;re good to go</p>

<p>Post in the comments if you used this tip and let me know if you run into any trouble.  This should work on other versions of Linux but the files may be in different places.  If you want to find your operating system&rsquo;s copy of &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; try running &ldquo;locate wrapper | grep -i teamviewer&rdquo; and it should come up in the list.  If you don&rsquo;t have locate installed you can try the much slower: &ldquo;find / -name &#8220;wrapper&rdquo; | grep -i teamviewer&#8221; to do the same thing.  Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found myself recently trying to determine where a particular piece of code was that was polluting my stdout stream with hundreds of unwanted messages.  This seemed like an impossible task since I could only guess that there was a line of code somewhere that was calling System.out.println(clazz.toString()) or something similar.  I searched the codebase high and low and found nothing.</p>

<p>After some Googling I came up with an alternate approach.  I disabled all of the code I could find that printed to stdout (actually this was easy since I do it all with one function so I just disabled that) and verified that I my application was still spewing out noise.  Sure enough it was and then I added a tiny chunk of code to my application&rsquo;s initialization.  That code takes over stdout and forcibly causes a NullPointerException.  It&rsquo;s unconventional and I probably could&rsquo;ve just put in a breakpoint but I wanted to make sure it crashed and spat out something I could work with immediately.</p>

<p>Here is what I did:</p>

<pre><code>System.setOut(new PrintStream(new OutputStream() {
  @Override
  public void write(int arg0) throws IOException {
    String forcedCrash = null;
    forcedCrash = forcedCrash + " ";
  }
}));
</code></pre>

<p>Let me know in the comments if you get a chance to use this to debug a project.  Since I came up with this technique I find myself putting it in action a lot more often than I thought I would so hopefully it&rsquo;ll be useful for you too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many people claim that Linux, Unix, and Mac OS do not need to be defragmented.  This is simply not true.  <a href="http://osxbook.com/software/hfsdebug/fragmentation.html">OSXBook explains that Apple&rsquo;s file systems fragment</a> and ext3 does as well.  To put it simply there are no file systems that I know of that do not fragment.  Even Apple&rsquo;s automatic defragmentation (why would it be there if it didn&rsquo;t fragment in the first place?) has limitations that cause file fragments to accumulate over time.  The value of defragmentation may be questionable to some but in my own informal tests I&rsquo;ve seen the read speeds on large sequential files like virtual machine snapshots double after defragmentation.</p>

<p>Anyway, my Linux machines were seeming sluggish lately and I decided to figure out how to install <a href="http://vleu.net/shake/">Shake</a> to remedy the problem.  The installation isn&rsquo;t bad but I&rsquo;ve already figured it out for you so just follow these steps to get yourself set up:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Add these lines to your /etc/apt/sources.list:</p>

<p>deb <a href="http://ppa.launchpad.net/un-brice/ppa/ubuntu">http://ppa.launchpad.net/un-brice/ppa/ubuntu</a> maverick main
deb-src <a href="http://ppa.launchpad.net/un-brice/ppa/ubuntu">http://ppa.launchpad.net/un-brice/ppa/ubuntu</a> maverick main</p></li>
<li><p> Run this command to add the author&rsquo;s key to your apt configuration:</p>

<p>sudo apt-key adv &mdash;keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com &mdash;recv-keys E2235DBB</p></li>
<li><p> Update your apt database:</p>

<p>sudo apt-get update</p></li>
<li><p> Install shake-fs:</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install shake-fs</p></li>
<li><p> Get a baseline of your existing fragmentation on the entire filesystem:</p>

<p>sudo shake -pvv / | awk &lsquo;{ printf(&ldquo;%06d,%s\n&rdquo;, $4, $8) }&rsquo; | sort > shake.full-output.before</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now you can look at the output in shake.full-output.before and see where you have fragmentation problems.  If you just want to run the defrag on the whole disk and include every file regardless of age and size do this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo shake --old=0 --bigsize=0 -X /
</code></pre>

<p>This will take a decent amount of time and will really sap the machine&rsquo;s performance.  Don&rsquo;t do this until you have a window of time where you can afford to not use the machine.</p>

<p>Finally, compare your before and after:</p>

<pre><code>sudo shake -pvv / | awk '{ printf("%06d,%s\n", $4, $8) }' | sort &gt; shake.full-output.after
tail shake.full-output.*
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully now the worst offenders at the bottom of the after file will be a bit more tidy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a big fan of the Avast! line of security products.  I just upgraded from Pro to Internet Security since I got a new laptop and getting the Pro version for that was the same price as the Internet Security version and I figured that an added firewall couldn&rsquo;t hurt.  Naturally, it&rsquo;s never that simple and I realized that after I rebooted the firewall was causing the web browsers in my virtual machines to lose access to the Internet.  I was still able to ping things via the command line but I couldn&rsquo;t do much else.</p>

<p>In order to fix this I found out that you just need to do the following steps and you&rsquo;re back online:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Open Avast!</p></li>
<li><p> Click the Firewall tab</p></li>
<li><p> Make sure the Firewall Settings sub-tab is selected</p></li>
<li><p> Click &ldquo;Expert Settings&rdquo; next to the &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; button</p></li>
<li><p> Check &ldquo;Internet Connection Sharing mode&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p> Click OK</p></li>
<li><p> Close Avast!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now your VMs are back online.  Post in the comments if you found it useful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just upgraded from a dual monitor to a triple monitor setup.  The strange thing was that when I went into my virtual machines, after rebooting them to recognize the new graphics cards, I couldn&rsquo;t get them to span all three displays.  When I pressed the button to switch monitor configurations it would alternate between the combinations of two different displays and then it would go to a configuration where the display was double width but centered across all three displays.  This left windows split across monitors and large vertical black bars on either side of things.  It wasn&rsquo;t pretty but I figured out what was wrong.</p>

<p>VMware has a notion of a virtual machine&rsquo;s video RAM.  By default this value is too low to support three 1920 x 1080 displays.  In order to fix this do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Determine the resolution of each of your screens.  In my case they all were 1920 x 1080.</p></li>
<li><p> Calculate the pixel count by multiplying the vertical resolution by the horizontal resolution.  This gave me 2,073,600.</p></li>
<li><p> Multiply each screen&rsquo;s pixel count by 4 (1 byte per pixel and 1 byte for alignment).  This gave me 8,294,400.</p></li>
<li><p> Add all of the values from step 3 together.  This now gives me 8,294,400 * 3 for my three displays so my total is 24,883,200 (approximately 24 MB).  This is approximately how many bytes of video memory you need.</p></li>
<li><p> Add a margin of error of about another 8,000,000.  This bumped my value up to 33,000,000.</p></li>
<li><p> Back up your VMX file and your VM.</p></li>
<li><p> Edit the VMX file and add this line at the bottom but replace 33000000 with your value from step 5. Note: Search the file to make sure this line doesn&rsquo;t exist already. If it does you&rsquo;ll need to modify it instead of adding a second one.</p>

<p>svga.vramSize=33000000</p></li>
<li><p> Save the configuration file and restart your VM</p></li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s it.  You&rsquo;ll now be able to run as many displays as you can afford.</p>
