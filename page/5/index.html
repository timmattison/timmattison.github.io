<time datetime="2010-10-11T22:15:11-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 11<span>th</span>, 2010</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been using Nanoblogger for years now and I really didn’t want to ditch it.  After seeing how infrequently I post though I realized that Nanoblogger was getting in the way ever since I switched back from my Mac to a PC.  Without decent command-line support Nanoblogger required me to fire up a VM, edit in vim, update the blog, and sync it with rsync.</p>

<p>All of this is computationally and bandwidth efficient but not exactly convenient.  Convenience is key for me when keeping a blog up to date.  Anything that I have to do that doesn’t involve writing articles just gets in the way.</p>

<p>So, I wanted to switch from Nanoblogger to WordPress.  There’s no simple migration path here for several reasons but I came up with something that does the job and doesn’t require you to mess with your Nanoblogger settings.  This way you can leave everything in place and come back to it if something breaks.</p>

<p>First, you’ll need to navigate to your blog/data directory.  This is where all of your blog posts are stored as text files.  Then, using the Perl script at the bottom of this page, convert them into a full RSS feed by running this command:</p>

<p>cat *.txt | perl convert.pl > myblog.rss</p>

<p>With the myblog.rss file you can import your posts using the WordPress RSS importer and it’ll contain every post you’ve ever written.  If you use the RSS feed that Nanoblogger generates on your site you’ll only get the last few posts.</p>

<p>The script, convert.pl, is simply this:</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/perl -w</h1>

<p>my $title;
my $date;
my $body;</p>

<p>my $inbody = 0;</p>

<p>while(<STDIN>) {
my $line = $_;</p>

<p>if($line =~ m/^TITLE: (.<em>)$/) {
$title = $1;
}
elsif ($line =~ m/^DATE: (.</em>)$/) {
$date = $1;</p>

<p>$date =~ s/^(&hellip;) (&hellip;) ([0-9][0-9]) ([0-9][0-9]):([0-9][0-9]):([0-9][0-9]) (&hellip;) (20[0-9][0-9])/$1, $3 $2 $8 $4:$5:$6 -0500/;
}
elsif($line =~ m/BODY:/) {
$inbody = 1;
$body = &ldquo;&rdquo;;
}
elsif($line =~ /END&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;/) {</p>

<h1>Done, write it all out</h1>

<p>print(&ldquo;<item>\n&rdquo;);
print(&ldquo;  <pubDate>$date</pubDate>\n&rdquo;);
print(&ldquo;  <title>$title</title>\n&rdquo;);
print(&ldquo;  &lt;content:encoded>$body&lt;/content:encoded>\n&rdquo;);
print(&ldquo;</item>\n&rdquo;);</p>

<p>$date = &ldquo;&rdquo;;
$title = &ldquo;&rdquo;;
$body = &ldquo;&rdquo;;
}
elsif($inbody == 1) {
$body = $body . $line;
}
}</p>

<p>Note that the date conversion code isn’t perfect so some posts will come out with dates of Dec. 31st, 1969.  You’ll have to fix those by hand.  Also, sometimes formatting isn’t perfect depending on how you wrote your posts initially.  Either way this turned hours of agonizing transcription into just a few seconds of work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got a Samsung Fascinate a few weeks back and it’s a great phone.  When I tried to hook it up today to do some development on it though I ran into trouble.  In the Windows device manager it just came up as a “Samsung Android” but Eclipse would not recognize it as a valid target.  In order to use this device, or any other Galaxy S product, as a debug target you need to do one more thing…</p>

<p>The secret is that you need to download Samsung’s USB drivers.  The standard ones that come with the Android development kit will not work even if you modify the INF file to include the USB IDs of the phone.  Samsung has <a href="http://j.mp/SamsungFascinateUSB">drivers specifically for the Fascinate</a>.  I didn’t find the Samsung drivers right away so I settled for Softpedia.  Normally I avoid Softpedia downloads but I scanned them and looked at them closely before installing and they seem legitimate.  There are two versions listed but I think they may both be the same since the x64 version I installed claimed to be x86.  So here they are:</p>

<p><a href="http://drivers.softpedia.com/get/MOBILES/Samsung/Samsung-Galaxy-S-USB-Driver-for-Windows-x64.shtml">Generic Galaxy S USB drivers for x64</a></p>

<p><a href="http://drivers.softpedia.com/get/MOBILES/Samsung/Samsung-Galaxy-S-USB-Driver-for-Windows-x86.shtml">Generic Galaxy X USB drivers for x86</a></p>

<p>Softpedia tries to trick you into clicking ads so first click “Download” to the left of the download counter for the file, then click the “Softpedia Secure Download (US) [ZIP]” link.  All of the other links are ads.</p>

<p>After you have installed the drivers reconnect your phone and it should install four different drivers relating to ADB.  Then you should see your device come up in the Android device manager when you try to launch your project in Eclipse.  If the manager doesn’t come up you should go to the “Run Configurations” for your project, select the “Target” tab, and then select “Manual” under “Deployment Target Selection Mode”.  This makes sure that when you launch this project it’ll try to open device manager.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I migrated to WordPress this weekend and after a few bumps in the road I think things are starting to settle.  Old static content is missing and the formatting of old posts probably needs to be touched up but it&rsquo;s a good start for now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going back and I&rsquo;m starting to categorize my articles.  First, one will be called &ldquo;uber&rdquo; and is for the most technical posts.  Then the two other standard categories will be &ldquo;mini-hacks&rdquo; for quick hacks and &ldquo;how-tos&rdquo; for longer how-to type posts.</p>

<p>Comments have moved from Disqus to WordPress for now until I get a chance to install Disqus again.  Any comments between now and then may be lost.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>gdgt has <a href="http://gdgt.com/google/chrome-os/download/">released a VMware image for Chrome OS</a> this week.  It works on all versions of VMware (not sure about ESX though), Virtual Box, and Parallels.  When I started it up in VMware Fusion I kept getting the message &ldquo;Network not connected and offline login fail&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The instructions explicitly say to switch from NAT to bridged but some users have found that it actually does work just fine with NAT.  In my case it still didn&rsquo;t work with either.  <a href="http://discuss.gdgt.com/google/chrome-os/general/Download-Chrome-OS-VMWare-image/page/2/">Luckily someone on the forums let us in on the secret</a> that you actually don&rsquo;t need a Google account at all to use this build.</p>

<p>If you want to try Chrome OS and you&rsquo;re having networking problems or you don&rsquo;t have a Google account just sign in as &ldquo;<a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#x63;&#x68;&#114;&#111;&#110;&#x6f;&#x73;&#x40;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x63;&#104;&#114;&#111;&#110;&#x6f;&#x73;&#64;&#x67;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a>&rdquo; (you can just type &ldquo;chronos&rdquo; and the OS will add &ldquo;@gmail.com&rdquo;) with no password.  You&rsquo;ll be brought straight into the OS without having to sign into Google first.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, after doing that the networking system came to life and I could log into GMail and check other sites.  If you&rsquo;re hung up on getting past the initial login screen definitely try the &ldquo;chronos&rdquo; account and let me know if it works for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I work with embedded Ethernet devices a lot and I need to monitor them to know exactly when they restart or if they go down during testing.  I used to do it with ping sitting on an external monitor and just glance up at it every few minutes to see what&rsquo;s happening.  This is a less than optimal solution since it requires me to constantly be distracted by a stream of information, it eats up screen real estate, and it forces me to keep an electron inhaling LCD panel running.</p>

<p>I just discovered that the standard ping utility in Linux and Mac OS has a neat feature to alleviate this pain.  It will output an audible bell on every packet either received (showing a device is online) or missed (showing a device is offline). It&rsquo;s your choice which one you use, of course.  Personally, I have only needed the offline alert since I just need to be able to get into devices to see what they&rsquo;re doing immediately after a planned restart.</p>

<p>To get audible notification for every packet missed do this:</p>

<pre><code>ping -A hostname
</code></pre>

<p>To get audible notification for every packet received do this:</p>

<pre><code>ping -a hostname
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can work without distraction until you hear those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character">BEL</a>s.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When developing Linux kernel modules, specifically ones that tie into procfs via the seq_file interfaces and have circular buffers, it&rsquo;s handy to be able to take an offset into your buffer and use the modulo operator (%) to make it wrap around easily.  In the kernel you&rsquo;re restricted to a smaller set of available operators however and modulo only works on certain types.</p>

<p>One type that it doesn&rsquo;t work on that happens to be used in the seq_file interface is loff_t.  If you try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>static void *my_procfs_seq_start(struct seq_file *s, loff_t *pos)
{
  return global_pointer + ((*pos) % CIRCULAR_BUFFER_SIZE);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You will probably get an error about the unresolved symbol &ldquo;_moddi3&rdquo;.  The quick fix for this is to do the following instead:</p>

<pre><code>static void *my_procfs_seq_start(struct seq_file *s, loff_t *pos)
{
  return global_pointer + (((int) (*pos)) % CIRCULAR_BUFFER_SIZE);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This simply converts your dereferenced loff_t pointer to an int.  <strong>Make sure your value will fit into your architecture&rsquo;s int size!</strong>.  If it doesn&rsquo;t, you&#8217;ll get strange results.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>VMware Server is a complicated beast.  When it breaks, you&rsquo;re usually without support (although <a href="mailto:sales@vmware.com">paid support options do exist</a>), and out of commission.  One problem that tripped me up for a few weeks was that I had a running VM that refused to suspend.  Because of this I couldn&rsquo;t get clean backups of the VM in a suspended state and had to resort to just a plain backup of the filesystem via rsync.  It worked, but it was less than optimal.  Any time I ran the suspend command:</p>

<pre><code>/opt/vmware/bin/vmrun suspend Gentoo.vmx
</code></pre>

<p>The error message I was presented with was:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Command failed: Cannot connect to the virtual machine
</code></pre>

<p>I could hobble along like this for a while but today I needed to add another virtual disk which required a restart of the VM.  When I tried to start it via the command-line tools like this:</p>

<pre><code>/opt/vmware/bin/vmrun start Gentoo.vmx
</code></pre>

<p>The system just hung indefinitely.  Eventually I had to CTRL-C out of it and get back to the command-line to figure out the issue.</p>

<p>What was the underlying problem?  Almost every time I&rsquo;ve had a VMware Server issue it has been permissions.  When you&rsquo;re working with VMs you should always make sure that the following criteria is applied to the files in the VM&rsquo;s working directory:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All files must be owned by the vmware user and/or the vmware group</p></li>
<li><p>All of the files must be readable and writeable by the vmware user and/or group</p></li>
<li><p>Disk files must be marked as executable by the vmware user and/or group</p></li>
<li><p>Optional: All permissions should be removed from anyone other than the owning user and/or group</p></li>
</ul>


<p>What I do to get this done quickly on all of my VMs is run the following few commands in each VM&rsquo;s working directory:</p>

<pre><code>chgrp vmware *
chmod 660 *vmem
chmod 660 *.vmsn
chmod 750 *.vmdk
chmod 750 *.vmsd
chmod 750 nvram
</code></pre>

<p>After running those few commands VMware Server works like a charm again.</p>
