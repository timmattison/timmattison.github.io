  <div class="entry-content"><p>gdgt has <a href="http://gdgt.com/google/chrome-os/download/">released a VMware image for Chrome OS</a> this week.  It works on all versions of VMware (not sure about ESX though), Virtual Box, and Parallels.  When I started it up in VMware Fusion I kept getting the message &ldquo;Network not connected and offline login fail&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The instructions explicitly say to switch from NAT to bridged but some users have found that it actually does work just fine with NAT.  In my case it still didn&rsquo;t work with either.  <a href="http://discuss.gdgt.com/google/chrome-os/general/Download-Chrome-OS-VMWare-image/page/2/">Luckily someone on the forums let us in on the secret</a> that you actually don&rsquo;t need a Google account at all to use this build.</p>

<p>If you want to try Chrome OS and you&rsquo;re having networking problems or you don&rsquo;t have a Google account just sign in as &ldquo;<a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#104;&#114;&#111;&#110;&#x6f;&#x73;&#64;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#99;&#x68;&#114;&#x6f;&#110;&#111;&#x73;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;</a>&rdquo; (you can just type &ldquo;chronos&rdquo; and the OS will add &ldquo;@gmail.com&rdquo;) with no password.  You&rsquo;ll be brought straight into the OS without having to sign into Google first.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, after doing that the networking system came to life and I could log into GMail and check other sites.  If you&rsquo;re hung up on getting past the initial login screen definitely try the &ldquo;chronos&rdquo; account and let me know if it works for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I work with embedded Ethernet devices a lot and I need to monitor them to know exactly when they restart or if they go down during testing.  I used to do it with ping sitting on an external monitor and just glance up at it every few minutes to see what&rsquo;s happening.  This is a less than optimal solution since it requires me to constantly be distracted by a stream of information, it eats up screen real estate, and it forces me to keep an electron inhaling LCD panel running.</p>

<p>I just discovered that the standard ping utility in Linux and Mac OS has a neat feature to alleviate this pain.  It will output an audible bell on every packet either received (showing a device is online) or missed (showing a device is offline). It&rsquo;s your choice which one you use, of course.  Personally, I have only needed the offline alert since I just need to be able to get into devices to see what they&rsquo;re doing immediately after a planned restart.</p>

<p>To get audible notification for every packet missed do this:</p>

<pre><code>ping -A hostname
</code></pre>

<p>To get audible notification for every packet received do this:</p>

<pre><code>ping -a hostname
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can work without distraction until you hear those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character">BEL</a>s.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When developing Linux kernel modules, specifically ones that tie into procfs via the seq_file interfaces and have circular buffers, it&rsquo;s handy to be able to take an offset into your buffer and use the modulo operator (%) to make it wrap around easily.  In the kernel you&rsquo;re restricted to a smaller set of available operators however and modulo only works on certain types.</p>

<p>One type that it doesn&rsquo;t work on that happens to be used in the seq_file interface is loff_t.  If you try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>static void *my_procfs_seq_start(struct seq_file *s, loff_t *pos)
{
  return global_pointer + ((*pos) % CIRCULAR_BUFFER_SIZE);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You will probably get an error about the unresolved symbol &ldquo;_moddi3&rdquo;.  The quick fix for this is to do the following instead:</p>

<pre><code>static void *my_procfs_seq_start(struct seq_file *s, loff_t *pos)
{
  return global_pointer + (((int) (*pos)) % CIRCULAR_BUFFER_SIZE);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This simply converts your dereferenced loff_t pointer to an int.  <strong>Make sure your value will fit into your architecture&rsquo;s int size!</strong>.  If it doesn&rsquo;t, you&#8217;ll get strange results.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>VMware Server is a complicated beast.  When it breaks, you&rsquo;re usually without support (although <a href="mailto:sales@vmware.com">paid support options do exist</a>), and out of commission.  One problem that tripped me up for a few weeks was that I had a running VM that refused to suspend.  Because of this I couldn&rsquo;t get clean backups of the VM in a suspended state and had to resort to just a plain backup of the filesystem via rsync.  It worked, but it was less than optimal.  Any time I ran the suspend command:</p>

<pre><code>/opt/vmware/bin/vmrun suspend Gentoo.vmx
</code></pre>

<p>The error message I was presented with was:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Command failed: Cannot connect to the virtual machine
</code></pre>

<p>I could hobble along like this for a while but today I needed to add another virtual disk which required a restart of the VM.  When I tried to start it via the command-line tools like this:</p>

<pre><code>/opt/vmware/bin/vmrun start Gentoo.vmx
</code></pre>

<p>The system just hung indefinitely.  Eventually I had to CTRL-C out of it and get back to the command-line to figure out the issue.</p>

<p>What was the underlying problem?  Almost every time I&rsquo;ve had a VMware Server issue it has been permissions.  When you&rsquo;re working with VMs you should always make sure that the following criteria is applied to the files in the VM&rsquo;s working directory:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All files must be owned by the vmware user and/or the vmware group</p></li>
<li><p>All of the files must be readable and writeable by the vmware user and/or group</p></li>
<li><p>Disk files must be marked as executable by the vmware user and/or group</p></li>
<li><p>Optional: All permissions should be removed from anyone other than the owning user and/or group</p></li>
</ul>


<p>What I do to get this done quickly on all of my VMs is run the following few commands in each VM&rsquo;s working directory:</p>

<pre><code>chgrp vmware *
chmod 660 *vmem
chmod 660 *.vmsn
chmod 750 *.vmdk
chmod 750 *.vmsd
chmod 750 nvram
</code></pre>

<p>After running those few commands VMware Server works like a charm again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With so many free streaming services available today (<a href="http://www.vimeo.com">Vimeo</a> being the best and <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> being the most widely recognized) you might wonder why someone would want to host their own videos.  My main reason is so that I can more easily see who watches my content.  Other reasons include better access control if your videos are personal in nature, or a more integrated, branded user experience if you&rsquo;re producing content that is subscription, pay-per-view or ad supported.  You might also want to get around the restrictions that come with the free accounts these sites offer without paying for their premium services.  If you&rsquo;re already invested in the hardware to host your site and you can support the bandwidth requirements for your expected traffic volume then it might make sense to host things yourself.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s the big deal?  If you&rsquo;re looking to get started right away you can render an MP4 file, install a free player like <a href="http://flowplayer.org/">FlowPlayer</a>, and start hosting video in 5 minutes.  The problem that you&rsquo;ll notice straight away is that your videos have to buffer completely (ie. the user&rsquo;s browser downloads the whole video) before they start playing.  For short videos or video files that are small this isn&rsquo;t a big deal.  But for HD videos and videos that are long in duration the delay can cause even the most patient viewers navigate away from your site.  Since all of the other services have gotten users accustomed to video playing immediately it&rsquo;s hard to justify this kind of behavior on any site today.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve figured out the secret sauce to get this working.  Now you can do it too with just these few simple steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Step 1: Render your MP4 files and place them on your server</p></li>
<li><p>Step 2: Create a webpage with <a href="http://flowplayer.org/">FlowPlayer</a> embedded.  A template to get you started looks like this:</p>

<p><head>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://your-site.com/flowplayer-3.2.4.min.js"></script>
</head></p>

<p><a href="http://your-site.com/your-video.mp4" style="display:block;width:800px;height:475px" id="player"> </a></p>

<p><script>flowplayer(&ldquo;player&rdquo;, &ldquo;flowplayer-3.2.5.swf&rdquo;,</p>

<p>{ clip:
  { url: &ldquo;<a href="http://your-site.com/your-video.mp4">http://your-site.com/your-video.mp4</a>&rdquo;,
    duration: 120,
    metadata: false,
    autoPlay: true,
    autoBuffer: true,
    bufferLength: 3,
    linkUrl: &ldquo;<a href="http://your-site.com/your-video-description.html">http://your-site.com/your-video-description.html</a>&rdquo;
  }
});</script></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Just replace your-site.com/your-video.mp4 with the real URL of your MP4 video and your-site.com/your-video-description.html with the site you want to link the user to if they click on the video while it&rsquo;s playing.  Also, replace &ldquo;120&rdquo; after the duration variable with the actual duration of your video in seconds.  If you don&rsquo;t know this value, or you&rsquo;re feeling lazy, you can set it to zero and FlowPlayer will figure it out for you.  Don&rsquo;t set it too short or your video will end prematurely and make sure that flowplayer-3.1.4.min.js is on your server in the appropriate location.  This example assumes it is in the root directory.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Step 3: Download and install mod_h264 for Apache.  There are instructions for <a href="http://h264.code-shop.com/trac/wiki/Mod-H264-Streaming-Apache-Version2">distros other than Gentoo</a> or youcan run these commands on Gentoo to do it all:</p>

<p>cd /tmp
wget <a href="http://h264.code-shop.com/download/apache_mod_h264_streaming-2.2.5.tar.gz">http://h264.code-shop.com/download/apache_mod_h264_streaming-2.2.5.tar.gz</a>
tar xzvf apache_mod_h264_streaming-2.2.5.tar.gz
rm apache_mod_h264_streaming-2.2.5.tar.gz
cd mod_h264_streaming-2.2.5
./configure
sudo make install</p></li>
<li><p>Step 4: Add mod_h264 for your Apache configuration.  Append these lines to the bottom of your /etc/apache/httpd.conf:</p>

<p>LoadModule h264_streaming_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_h264_streaming.so
AddHandler h264-streaming.extensions .mp4</p></li>
<li><p>Step 5: Restart apache with</p>

<p>/etc/init.d/apache restart</p></li>
<li><p>Step 6: Test out your streaming video.  If all went well then you&rsquo;ll see the bar behind the playhead fill in as the video buffers.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it.  Thanks to the mod_h264 developers (and these instructions) you&rsquo;re now able to stream MP4 video like the big guys.  Here&rsquo;s an example of what it should look like (the source material in this video is from <a href="http://freestockphotos.com/">FreeStockPhotos.com</a> but the controls in the player cut off their watermark):</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Even though I have a nice dual monitor setup in my office I tend to use my laptop for almost everything.  The dual monitor system ends up holding a bunch of diagnostic and performance information (top, PProcM, tail of application/database logs, etc)  about the various machines I&rsquo;m working on.  Because of this I&rsquo;m almost never using the keyboard and mouse on that machine and in fact it often doesn&rsquo;t have a keyboard and mouse hooked up.  Typically I just access it just using <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/">x11vnc</a> so I don&rsquo;t have to switch my wireless mouse over or go find a free keyboard.</p>

<p>The problem is that the screen blanker kicks in every 15 minutes or so.  I got tired of reconnecting via VNC to turn the displays back on so I just did a quick mod to my /etc/X11/xorg.conf and now I just turn the displays off manually whenever I don&rsquo;t need them.  If you want to do the same thing just add the following section right before the input device section (found on <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/cannot-unset-powersave-mode-582229/">these forums</a>):</p>

<pre><code>Section "ServerFlags"
    Option         "blank time" "0"
    Option         "standby time" "0"
    Option         "suspend time" "0"

<p>According to <a href="http://qaix.com/postgresql-database-development/445-710-information-schema-pg-keypositions-in-8-1-read.shtml">a forum I came across</a> this is because the Hibernate team ended up depending on a function in PostgreSQL 8.0 that was dropped in 8.1+.  I needed to make some modifications to the code posted there to get it to work so here&rsquo;s what I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION information_schema._pg_keypositions() RETURNS SETOF integer
LANGUAGE sql
IMMUTABLE
AS $pg_keypositions$
select g.s
from generate_series(1,current_setting('max_index_keys')::int, 1)
as g(s)
$pg_keypositions$;
</code></pre>

<p>Once you run this code in your database you&rsquo;ll never be bothered with that error message again.  Basically this just gets the max_index_keys value and generates a list of integers from 1 to that value, inclusive.  Hibernate can live without it but removing a repetitive error message will keep your DBA and sysadmins sane a bit longer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week my fiancée&rsquo;s brand new HP laptop started turning off after being unplugged for less than 3 minutes.  The battery was in such bad shape that Windows didn&#8217;t shut down properly, it just completely turned off.  I made sure the battery was fully charged and tested it again.  Sure enough after 3 minutes it would just forcibly shut off.</p>

<p>We called tech support to get a replacement and we were put through over an hour worth of msconfig tweaks and all kinds of stuff.  In the end we were told to run the &#8221;HP Battery Check&#8221; utility.  This utility said the battery was fine so we were out of luck as far as the warranty was concerned.  However, after we got off of the phone we were able to get a battery &ldquo;warranty ID&rdquo; that we could use to get a replacement.  If you are having similar battery problems here&rsquo;s what you should do to save yourself some trouble.</p>

<p>Step 1: Run the &ldquo;HP Battery Check&rdquo; utility.  If it gives you a warranty ID just <a href="callto:+1800-474-6836">call HP tech support</a> and give that to them.  They will take care of the rest.  Otherwise, continue to step 2.</p>

<p>Step 2: Set your power plan to &ldquo;HP Recommended&rdquo; by clicking on the battery icon in the system tray and selecting it from the list.</p>

<p>Step 3: Verify that your battery really only lasts a few minutes and then forcibly powers off.  If Windows shuts down properly then you probably have a battery that has a decreased capacity but that&rsquo;s not actually defective.  HP will not replace these kinds of batteries.  If it appears defective but the battery check says it&rsquo;s OK proceed to step 4.</p>

<p>Step 4: Restart Windows</p>

<p>Step 5: Charge the battery to 100%</p>

<p>Step 6: Start the &ldquo;HP Battery Check&rdquo; utility and get a pen and paper.  You&rsquo;ll need to be fast to get this information down.</p>

<p>Step 7: Unplug the power until you see the battery meter decrease by more than 2%.  This should happen in just a few seconds if the battery is defective.  Note that the battery status in the utility should read &ldquo;Invalid&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Step 8: Plug the power back in.  After a few seconds you should see that the utility says &ldquo;Replace&rdquo;.  Write down the warranty ID (a 27-digit number) as fast as possibly.  If your battery is flaky in a few seconds the status will go back to &ldquo;Good&rdquo; and the ID will disappear.  If it says &ldquo;Good&rdquo; again you can try a few times.  It took two tries for me to get the number the first time but then it no longer showed the &ldquo;Replace&rdquo; message and warranty ID.</p>

<p>Step 9: Call HP, give them the warranty ID, and wait for your new battery to arrive</p>

<p>This won&rsquo;t work for all HP battery problems but it&rsquo;s worth a shot before you sink a lot of time into a tech support call that benefits neither you nor HP.  This is a good, quick way to see if your battery is defective in a way that a normal tech support call to HP wouldn&rsquo;t pick up.  If you&rsquo;ve already talked to HP and your battery is considered &ldquo;Good&rdquo; this is always worth a shot to get a free, legitimate replacement.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&rsquo;s another thing I ran into today when adding support for KVM to my kernel&hellip; VMware Workstation&rsquo;s modules failed to load at boot time.  Normally, the fix is to run:</p>

<pre><code>vmware-modconfig --console --install-all
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>emerge --config vmware-workstation
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Neither of these will work on the latest versions of Gentoo</strong>.  The real fix is to re-emerge your vmware-modules package.  You can do this by just running:</p>

<pre><code>emerge vmware-modules
</code></pre>

<p>That will build the modules against your current running kernel.  After that, your modules will work again but will not be loaded.  You need to forcibly reload them by running:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/init.d/vmware restart
</code></pre>

<p>Each time you change your kernel, which means even booting into one that previously worked, you&rsquo;ll need to do this again.  For convenience if you change your kernel a lot you can just put those two commands into a script.  The script, which I call &ldquo;fix-vmware-modules.sh&rdquo;, should just look like this:</p>

<pre><code>emerge vmware-modules
/etc/init.d/vmware restart
rc-update add vmware default
</code></pre>

<p>I added the extra rc-update command just in case you run this on a machine that you just installed VMware Workstation on.  It makes sure the modules are loaded at boot time and it won&rsquo;t hurt an existing installation.  Instead it will just let you know that it&rsquo;s already added to the default runlevel.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>NetFlix just released software that enables consumers to watch their instant queue on a PlayStation 3.  Of course, the XBOX 360 has had this capability for quite some time but now users of either console can stream movies to their TVs without purchasing a Roku or a compatible DVD/BluRay player.  This move will open up their customer base considerably since a lot of people who have purchased a PS3 can&rsquo;t easily justify spending another $100 for a device just to watch their Instant Queue.</p>

<p>NetFlix, for those who don&rsquo;t subscribe, lets you receive DVDs or BluRay disks in the mail or watch movies online.  Only a small percentage of their total movie count is available online so you&rsquo;ll probably end up having to wait for some things to arrive in the mail instead of getting instant gratification.  The collection of online movies grows every week though and there are tons of titles (movies, TV shows, documentaries) that are worth watching on it.  When you find movies that you want you add them to your queue.  There is a separate queue for movies that will arrive in the mail and movies that you can watch online.  We&rsquo;ll focus on the &ldquo;Instant Queue&rdquo; from here on out.</p>

<p>The NetFlix software comes in the mail like any other movie would normally.  The only difference is that NetFlix uses a different mailer that lets you know that you don&rsquo;t need to return this DVD to them.  When you want to watch a movie online you just need to pop it into your PS3, go to the Video menu, and select NetFlix.  But first, you have to let NetFlix know you have a PS3.  Log into your account and <a href="http://www.netflix.com/ps3">go to the signup page</a>.  NetFlix will send the disk in a few days.</p>

<p>The first time you use it you&rsquo;ll be presented with an activation screen.  This is how NetFlix associates your PS3 with your particular NetFlix account.  You&rsquo;ll see a code on the screen that you&rsquo;ll need to provide to NetFlix.  You can either go to the URL they show you directly (<a href="http://www.netflix.com/ps3">http://www.netflix.com/ps3</a>) or, because NetFlix is smart, you can log into your account and they&rsquo;ll show you a banner when you first log in that tells you how to activate your device.  Once you enter the code on this page your PS3 will start pulling down the list of movies you have in your Instant Queue.</p>

<p>From this point it looks similar to the Roku with a few extra menu items that actually let you add movies to your Instant Queue directly from the PS3.  There&rsquo;s no feature to search for a title by name unfortunately so you&rsquo;re at the mercy of their suggestions for you.  Aside from that you get the standard red/gray NetFlix branded look and feel that you expect from any other device.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s good and what&rsquo;s bad?  Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve come up with.</p>

<p>The Bad</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Just like the Roku, there is no capability to fast forward or rewind without rebuffering.  This can get annoying if some dialog is hard to hear or you want to watch a scene a few times.  This should be addressed soon, especially considering the hardware at their disposal on the PS3.</p></li>
<li><p>When movies are in standard definition the PS3 goes into 480P mode.  What it should really do is stay in the current video mode and scale the picture up appropriately.  Why does it matter?  The user interface looks really good in high definition, in standard definition it looks very chunky.  It loses its consistent look and feel when things like this, that a user sees all the time, change from movie to movie.</p></li>
<li><p>As you move around the menus the PS3 has to fetch the cover art and movie list over and over again</p></li>
<li><p>There is no way to search for movies by title</p></li>
<li><p>The interface can be a bit sluggish, especially when trying to pause a movie.  However, it is more responsive than the Roku.</p></li>
<li><p>The directional pad and trigger buttons don&rsquo;t function as you&rsquo;d expect.  To scroll through movies you need to keep pressing the buttons or triggers for each movie.  Holding them down should keep scrolling at a reasonable pace but instead it scrolls just one movie no matter how long it is pressed.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to insert a DVD to watch a movie online.  It feels weird to do that.  It should be available to download online and to install on the hard drive from the disk.</p></li>
<li><p>Just like the Roku, when you pause a movie the pause icon and the timeline stay on top of the video.  If you&rsquo;re trying to pause to see something on the bottom of the screen then these will definitely occlude your view.  They should fade out after a few seconds.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The Good</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can watch NetFlix on my PS3, of course.  Coincidentally, I can now move my Roku into another room without having to buy a third device.</p></li>
<li><p>You can browse new movies and recommended movies on the PS3.  You don&rsquo;t need to grab a computer and sign onto the site anymore unless you&rsquo;re looking for a specific movie.</p></li>
<li><p>The user interface in 720P looks a lot nicer than the Roku.  The fonts are cleaner and it feels like the screen is used more effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>As you move through the interface you &ldquo;slide&rdquo; from screen to screen.  On the Roku, probably due to limited CPU capabilities, you &ldquo;snap&rdquo; from one screen to another.  The animation gives you a better idea of where you were and where you&rsquo;re going.  It&rsquo;s easy to feel lost on the Roku when you press the wrong button because the whole screen changes instantly.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a list of recently watched movies.  If you watched a movie and removed it from your queue on the Roku you can&rsquo;t get back to it without going through the NetFlix site.  Whether it&rsquo;s still in your queue or not it&rsquo;s in the recently watched list.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a list of new arrivals.  It&rsquo;s nice to see that NetFlix is actively adding movies to their streaming service without searching on your computer.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So what&rsquo;s my final verdict?  I&rsquo;d give it a 7 out of 10 because of the few, fixable issues I&rsquo;ve seen.  If you have a PS3 you should go to NetFlix now and order your disk to check it out for yourself.  If you&rsquo;re considering a Roku or a PS3 I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that you&rsquo;ll get more mileage out of a PS3 at this point.  A Roku is definitely a better choice for a second or third room though since the price and power consumption is much lower.</p>
